Hello Testify!

This is my first Java script on IntelliJ.

These are my first Java code lines, and I'm doing
this to figure out how it all works, but I believe
this will be an interesting ride.

I'm Can-Do Sylvia, and I'm absolutely ready to take
the world of Software Testing, Java and Tech by storm

See you again soon, Cheers!
